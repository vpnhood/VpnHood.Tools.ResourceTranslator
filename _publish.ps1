# One-shot local publish trigger: ship committed work and dispatch the NuGet publish CI.
#
#   1. Aborts if the working tree has any uncommitted changes — commit or stash first.
#   2. git pull (merge) — picks up earlier CI bump commits ("Publish vX.Y.Z" by github-actions[bot]).
#   3. git push — CI publishes what is on GitHub, not what is on this machine.
#   4. Dispatches publish_nugets.yml, which does the real work on GitHub via the shared module in
#      vpnhood/VpnHood (bump the version, pack, push to nuget.org) and pushes the version-bump
#      commit BACK to this branch — so pull again before your next work.
#
# This repo publishes with independent_version: it keeps its own 1.x line and never adopts the
# monorepo version. Only the build number self-bumps; a minor/major is a hand edit of
# pub/PubVersion.json + Directory.Build.props.
#
# Requires the GitHub CLI (gh) authenticated for this repo.
#
# Usage:
#   ./_publish.ps1                # publish what is already committed
#   ./_publish.ps1 -prerelease    # manual escape hatch: X.Y.Z-prerelease
